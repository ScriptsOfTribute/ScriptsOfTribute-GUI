This debug tool is deprecated and not maintained anymore. It got replaced with newer tool [Scripts of Tribute 2.0](https://github.com/Ematerasu/ScriptsOfTribute-2.0)

------

# Scripts of Tribute (SoT) GUI
GUI App created in Unity based on [Script of Tribute engine](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core)

## Setup
To run locally, you need the Unity editor at version `2021.3.7f1` or later. Build settings are left default for Windows, Mac and Linux platforms.

## Features
At the moment, one can play only against a bot. To do so, you need to add a DLL file with the AI class to the `StreamingAssets` directory in the project (or in the build). While playing, there are several features to play with, such as logs or moves history.

## Bots
In this project, we added several AIs to play with. Some of them were created for testing or debugging pruposes, such as the "Timeout bot".
